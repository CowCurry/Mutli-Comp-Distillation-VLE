# Stage-by-Stage Multi-Component Distillation Simulation

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive simulation of a multi-component distillation column on a stage-by-stage basis. It incorporates advanced Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium (VLE) and Vapor-Liquid-Liquid Equilibrium (VLLE) data, along with detailed energy and mass balances for each stage. The simulation aims to optimize the reflux ratio for cost efficiency while ensuring effective separation of components.

## Features
- **Component Properties:** Define multiple chemical components with detailed properties including molecular weight, heat of vaporization, vapor pressure coefficients, liquid density, and specific heats.
- **Advanced VLE Data Generation:** Generates VLE data across a range of temperatures with realistic pressure calculations.
- **Stage-by-Stage Simulation:** Simulates each distillation stage individually, performing energy and mass balances.
- **Reflux Ratio Optimization:** Utilizes optimization algorithms to determine the most cost-effective reflux ratio.
- **Detailed Output:** Generates CSV files with simulation results and plots visualizing temperature and pressure profiles across stages.
- **Cost Analysis:** Calculates the total cost based on energy balances and reflux ratios.
